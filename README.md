Quantum walk (QW) is the quantum analog of the classical random walk (CRW). QW is an integral part of the development of numerous quantum algorithms. Hence, an in-depth understanding of QW helps us grasp quantum algorithms. In this repository, three MATLAB codes are provided that generate the probability distribution of a CRW, QW, and QW under decoherence.
